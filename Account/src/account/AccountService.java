    // - the transfer only succeeds if there is enough balance on the FROM account,
    // i.e. if balance on this account is 50 and amount to transfer is 100, the method should throw an exception
    // - the amountToTransfer is always positive - providing negative value should throw an exception

    // It should never deadlock and it should make sure that all operations leave accounts in a consistent state
    // regardless of how many concurrent operations are happening in the system.
